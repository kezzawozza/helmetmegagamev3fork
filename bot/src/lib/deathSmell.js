// Every 2–5 hours, randomized, any Location holding a rotten corpse gets one

//
// WHY A setTimeout CHAIN AND NOT CRON. node-cron expresses "every N", never
// "somewhere between 2 and 5 hours from now", and the randomness is the point:
// a fixed cadence would make the smell a clock players could read, and the
// thing it is meant to do is nag unpredictably until somebody buries the body.
// So each firing picks its own next delay.
//
// WHY IT NEEDS NO CLEANUP. The message goes to Location.discordChannelId, and
// the message wipe already deletes every top-level message in a Location channel
// except the pinned anchor (CHANNELS.md). So the only obligations here are
// negative ones, and they matter: never pin this, and never write its id
// anywhere the wipe treats as an anchor. Do neither and it clears itself.
