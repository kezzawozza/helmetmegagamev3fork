    // wherever a thread is made from a message, and an "added X to the thread"
    // line every time somebody is let into a private Room or a Conversation.

    // it names the character being let in, which the DM to that character has
    // already said in better words.

    // RecipientAdd/RecipientRemove are Discord's group-DM message types reused
    // for thread membership, which is why the names read oddly here.

    // THOSE TWO DO NOT WORK, and are left in deliberately. Discord refuses to
    // delete a thread member-add notice — the call 400s and lands in the catch
    // below. There is no flag on PUT /thread-members to suppress it either, so
    // there is no way to be rid of one after it exists. They stay listed so

    // they get the key and never again on arrival (db/lib/roomAccess.js). The
    // pin and thread-created notices above are genuinely deletable and this is
    // still what clears them.

    // Scoped to notices the BOT itself caused, so a human pinning something in
    // #general still leaves the usual trace. Every in-game add runs on the bot
    // token (db/lib/discordRest.js#addThreadMember and the two
    // channel.members.add call sites), so that scoping costs us nothing and
    // still leaves a GM's hand-add in the Discord UI visible. And placed ABOVE
