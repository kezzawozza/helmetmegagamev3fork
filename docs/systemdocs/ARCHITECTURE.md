# Architecture

How the three packages fit together, and the handful of conventions that
recur everywhere. Subsystem detail lives in the other docs — this page is the
map and the cross-cutting rules.

## 1. Three packages, one database

An npm-workspaces monorepo:

| Package | What it is | Entry |
|---|---|---|
| `bot/` | The Discord bot, discord.js v14, holds a **gateway** connection | `bot/src/index.js` |
| `web/` | Next.js 16 App Router, JavaScript, Tailwind v4. **REST only** — no gateway | `web/app` |
| `db/` | `@lifeweb/db` — Prisma schema, the singleton client, and all shared game logic | `db/index.js` |

Both faces read and write the same Postgres through the same singleton, so
game state has exactly one home. Deployment is Railway: `bot` and `web` run as
two services from this repo against one Postgres instance.

**Anything both faces need belongs in `db/lib/`**, not duplicated. That's why
the rules modules (`specialChannels.js`, `laborAccess.js`, `seatZone.js`,
`gambitModifier.js`, `persistence.js`, `characterName.js`, `zoneChannelSpec.js`)
live there as pure functions with no Prisma or Discord dependency of their own.

## 2. The barrel, and when not to use it

`db/index.js` re-exports most of `db/lib/` as `@lifeweb/db`. Three deliberate
exceptions, all requiring by path instead:

- **`db/lib/dm.js`** — there are three `sendDm` functions with three different
  signatures (bot gateway, web REST, db REST). A bare `sendDm` on the barrel
  would be a coin flip. See §4.
- **`db/lib/archive.js`** — takes `prisma` as its first parameter because
  `db/index.js` imports *it*; requiring the barrel back would resolve to a
  partial, prisma-less exports object.
- **`db/lib/factionPermissions.js`** — same parameter convention, with
  `web/lib/factionPermissions.js` as a thin shim binding the singleton so web
  callers keep the shorter signature.
- **`db/lib/parties.js`** and **`db/lib/resourceTransfer.js`** — the shared
  "move ⬢ between two parties" primitive
  (`resolveParty`/`partyKey`/`partyLabel`, `moveParty`/`applyTransfer`), same
  prisma-first-parameter convention. Promoted out of the player-facing
  `TRANSFER_RESOURCES` request (`web/app/(app)/character/requestActions.js`,
  `web/lib/tagEffects.js`) so the turn-end push (`db/lib/stagedPush.js`,
  CommonJS, no Next.js request context) and every GM transfer surface
  (`web/lib/gmTransfer.js`) share the exact same clamp and ordering. See
  `FACTIONS.md` §5 and `ADJUDICATION.md` §1.

A module reached from a **client component** must not come through the barrel
at all — the barrel pulls in Prisma and the YAML syncs (`node:fs`), neither of
which bundles for the browser. `web/lib/characterCreation.js` imports
`@lifeweb/db/lib/roleCapacity` directly for exactly this reason.

**Reach for the deep path, not a copy.** The escape hatch above is a
*re-export*, and it is what `web/lib/` shims are for: `characterName.js`,
`turnFormat.js` and `formatTagRequirement.js` all name
`@lifeweb/db/lib/<module>` and re-export from it. The deep path resolves
because `db/package.json` declares **no `exports` map**, so it reaches the
module without ever loading `db/index.js`.

Two of those used to be hand-maintained *copies* instead, byte-identical to
their originals apart from `export function` vs `module.exports`. Both were in
sync when they were replaced, but only because whoever last edited one
remembered the other existed — and the failure mode is silent: a tag
requirement reading one way in a web tooltip and another in a Discord inspect
embed. A copy is never the right answer here; the deep path costs one line.

Use **named** re-exports rather than `export *`. The targets are CommonJS, and
a star re-export makes Turbopack emit runtime interop and warn on every build.

**Never use `__dirname` in `db/lib`.** Go through `db/lib/repoPaths.js#docsPath`
for anything under `docs/`. Turbopack *inlines* `__dirname` as a literal when
it bundles a module, and `db/lib`'s became `"/ROOT/db/lib"` — `/ROOT` is its
project-root placeholder and is never remapped — so in the Next server build
every `path.join(__dirname, "..", "..", "docs", …)` resolved to `/ROOT/docs/…`
and simply did not exist.

Six call sites had it, and they failed silently in different ways: the `#turns`
turn banner does `fs.existsSync` and treats absence as "no banner today", so
the image just stopped appearing; the four YAML re-syncs threw ENOENT into a
`.catch()`, so **Restart Game reported success having reprovisioned nothing.**

It only ever broke the **web** container. The bot runs unbundled, where
`__dirname` is real — which is why the same turn advance behaved differently
depending on whether the cron or the Dev Panel triggered it, and why it looked
intermittent.

`serverExternalPackages` does not fix this, though it is the documented way to
stop Next bundling a package: `@lifeweb/db` is a workspace symlink, so Next
resolves it to a real path outside `node_modules` and treats it as first-party
source. Verified by setting it, rebuilding, and finding all six literals still
in the output.

The same rule applies to plain data. `web/lib/requests.js` imports the barrel,
so its label maps were unreachable from any client component and the Dev
Panel's Record tab rendered raw DB enums instead; they now live in
a Prisma-free module, with the server-side file re-exporting them for its
server-side callers. `web/lib/moves.js` is the same idea for Moves.

## 3. The REST/gateway twin pattern

The bot has a gateway client; the web app only has REST. Where both need the
same Discord behaviour, there are **two implementations of the same rule**,
kept in sync by hand:

| Behaviour | Gateway (bot) | REST (web / db) |
|---|---|---|
| Send a logged DM | `bot/src/lib/dm.js` | `web/lib/discordGuild.js`, `db/lib/dm.js` |
| Is this a tupper/summary channel | `bot/src/lib/channels.js` | `web/lib/discordGuild.js` |
| Build a nickname | `bot/src/lib/nickname.js#buildNickname` | `web/lib/discordGuild.js#buildNickname` |
| Post as a character | `bot/src/lib/proxy.js#postAsCharacterTo` (`sendAsCharacter` wraps it) | `db/lib/discordRest.js#postAsCharacter` |
| Zone access | `bot/src/lib/zoneTravel.js#swapZoneRole` | `web/lib/discordGuild.js#syncCharacterZoneRole` |
| Special-channel access | `bot/src/lib/zoneTravel.js#syncCharacterNarrowcastAccess` | `web/lib/discordGuild.js` (same name) |

**If you change one, change its twin.** Both zone twins do the same two calls
in the same order — **grant before revoke**, so an interrupted swap shows a
player two zones rather than none.

Where the *rule* can be shared it already is: `computeNarrowcastAccess`,
`seatZoneIdFor` and `zoneChannelSpec` are single pure functions every caller
reads, and what is duplicated is only the Discord plumbing around them. Three
things that *could* have been twins deliberately aren't, and live once in
`db/` as REST-only helpers both faces require by path:

- **`db/lib/accessSweep.js`** — the death/departure/restart revoke. Blind
  channel sweeps have no gateway-only form worth having.
- **`db/lib/threadInvites.js#applyPendingInvites`** — a thread-member add has
  no gateway-only form at all, so both travel paths call the same function.
- **`db/lib/specialChannels.js`** — the registry: one entry per special
  channel, describing provisioning, wipe, ghost visibility and the access rule
  together, so the logic can't be smeared across a script, two twins and the
  wipe.
- **`db/lib/discordMirror/`** — the whole desired-state/diff/apply pipeline
  that keeps Discord structure true to the database (categories, channels,
  roles, threads, overwrites). It's REST-only by design, not by omission: it
  runs from a web server action (the editor save, the "Reconcile now" button),
  from ops scripts, and from the bot's own ready pass and turn wrapup — all
  four go through the same REST calls in `db/lib/discordRest.js`, so there is
  nothing gateway-specific for a twin to duplicate.

## 4. Side effects are returned, not performed

A recurring shape: a function that does database work **hands its Discord work
back to the caller** rather than doing it.

- `advanceTurn()` returns a `runSideEffects` thunk (`TURN-ENGINE.md` §3).
- `runHungerPass` returns `starvedDiscordUserIds`.
- `runAutoLaborPass` returns `dms`.
- `runLessonPass` (`db/lib/lessonPass.js`, `LESSONS.md`) returns `dms`, run
  between `autoLabor` and `stagedPush`.
- `performTravel` returns `oldZone` so each caller runs its own access twin.

Two reasons, both load-bearing:

1. **The caller knows which Discord client it has.** The bot awaits inline; the
   web app has no gateway and often defers to `after()`.
2. **Awaiting Discord inside a server action freezes the web app.** A pending
   server action blocks client-side navigation, and the message wipe is minutes
   long. The turn commits, the response flushes, Discord catches up behind it.

## 5. Rate-limit discipline

Everything that talks to Discord in a loop is **sequential**, never
`Promise.all`. This is not incidental: Discord bans an IP for an hour after
10,000 invalid responses (401/403/429) in 10 minutes, and sequential awaiting
makes that unreachable — at most one request is ever in flight. Valid requests
never count toward it, however fast.

`db/lib/discordRest.js#discordRequest` is the central wrapper, and **everything
goes through it**: bounded retry on 429 honouring `retry_after`, the capped
wait, the breaker check, the invalid-response count, and pre-emption on
`X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0`. It throws on any other non-2xx unless `allow404`,
and every error it throws carries `status` and `discordCode` so callers can
tell a dead webhook from a rate limit without reading the message text.

Two calls need something other than a JSON body with a bot header, and both say
so with an option rather than by hand-rolling a second, weaker retry loop:

- `executeWebhook` passes `auth: false` — the webhook token in the URL *is* the
  credential, and sending a bot `Authorization` header alongside it makes
  Discord authorize as the bot instead.
- `postAttachment` passes `formData` (a factory, so a retry gets a fresh body)
  — Discord takes attachments as `multipart/form-data` only.

Both used to be bare fetches on exactly that reasoning, which covered their
headers and not their retry logic. `executeWebhook` is the one call driven in a
loop over the whole roster, so a 429 there is the expected steady state on a
busy turn; `postAttachment` slept on an uncapped `retry_after` and could park a
turn advance for ten minutes.

The web side has no DM wrapper of its own any more: `web/lib/discordGuild.js#sendDm`
calls `postDmBatched`, which caches the DM channel and splits anything over
2000 characters. The old local `dmFetch` re-wrapped `discordRequest` only to
prefix the error message, and that rebuild dropped the status code.

**Swallowing a Discord failure is not the same as tolerating it.** A
best-effort side effect still has to leave a trace — a log line, and for
anything a GM initiated, an `AuditLog` row. `sendGmMessage` is the worked
example: a `.catch(() => null)` per recipient once made a broadcast report
success for messages nobody received.

## 6. Snapshot columns, not foreign keys

`AuditLog` and `ArchiveEntry` both store plain indexed id
columns plus **name snapshots**, with no relations. Two reasons:

- Zones and Characters can still be deleted — a superadmin hard-deleting a
  place from `/gm/dev/zones`, or `wipeGameData` clearing Characters. A real
  relation would either take the log with it or fail on FK ordering — which
  Restart Game has been bitten by. `SystemReport` is the newest table on the
  same plan.
- The snapshot is the more correct record anyway: who someone was known as
  *at the time*.

The same reasoning is why `Character.name` and `Character.zoneId` exist as
denormalized mirrors. Both have a defined set of writers; see `CHARACTERS.md`
and `MAP.md`.
