// The point-buy experience, shared by both stores: a catalog pane on the
// left, "Your Build" on the right. Character creation and the mid-game
// /store mount the SAME component so the two read as one system.
//
// `afterStartOnly` distinguishes them: creation offers every purchasable
// tag, the store only tags still buyable once play is underway.
// `grantedTags` is what the buyer already owns going in (role's starting
// tags, or the whole sheet in the store) — discounts chain upgrades and
// satisfies requirements. `negativeCap`/`negativeHeld` (TAGS.md §4a) is a
// creation-only rule; a null cap renders and dims nothing.

// A name in one of the build pane's two lists, with the catalog row's own
// detail on hover. The pane is deliberately narrow and its list scrolls, so
// the description cannot simply be printed under every name the way TagRow
// prints it — HoverCard is what makes that workable here. It portals to
// document.body, so the panel escapes the list's overflow-y-auto instead of
// being clipped by it, and a click pins it open, which is the whole touch
// story.
//
// The panel is TagDetails, the same block the sheet's chips and rows render,
// rather than the shorter hand-rolled one this used to carry. Two panels for
// one job drifted the way two of anything does: the buying screen never
// mentioned who else can see a tag, whether it conceals you, what it weighs or
// how long it lasts — all of which a player is deciding on — and its armour
// line had been dead for as long as the catalog's projection had no armour
// columns in it. One block, so a tag reads the same wherever it is met.
