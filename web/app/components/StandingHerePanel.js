// A server component, so `statusWord` comes off the shared module rather than
// a copy — the sheet and the Location's own ambient lines have to agree about
// what "half-built" means. Rendered beside LedgerWork.js on the sheet, and only
// when something is here: an empty panel saying nothing stands here is noise
// on every Location in the game.
