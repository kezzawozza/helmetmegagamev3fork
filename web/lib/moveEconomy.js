// this turn" is entirely "does an Action row exist for (characterId, the open
// Turn)" — the check the bot's Move modal and db/lib/locationTravel.js each make
// independently. Everything here follows from
// that one fact, and it is why giving a turn back means DELETING a row rather
// than flipping a flag.
//
// Extracted from gm/turns/actions.js#rejectMoveImpl so the Dev Panel's
// Restore-turn button and the Moves panel's Reject share one definition.
// Two copies would drift the first time Action.appliedEffects grows a key.

// Character row instead: EVERY crossing this turn — free or paid — claims
// against zoneMovesUsed/zoneMovesTurnId. Undoing the Action alone left that
