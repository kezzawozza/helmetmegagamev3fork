// remove. Sun Sensitivity is new.
//
// This gates the **Look at** button on /character only. The 🔍 reaction in
// Discord stays open on purpose: that one needs the subject to have just
// spoken beside you, which is close enough to see whatever your eyes are.
//
// No Prisma import, same posture as inspectVision.js beside it — the sheet
// wants the answer to grey a button, and the server action wants it to refuse,
// and neither should be able to drift from the other.
