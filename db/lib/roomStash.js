// (or a tx) as a parameter, same reason as db/lib/dm.js, and stays off the
// @lifeweb/db barrel; require it by path.

// findMany + a JS pick rather than ORDER BY random(): Prisma would need raw
// SQL for that, and a Location has a handful of rooms at most. Every PUBLIC
// room is a valid destination, provisioned or not — an unprovisioned one
// simply gets no announcement.
// A room that eats what is put into it (Room.destroysContents — the Godard
// Factory's Spillway) is NEVER eligible. The overflow drop is not a choice
// anybody made: a refining shift makes 136 lb of Squeeze against an 84 lb cap,
// so the carry pass fires on the intended loop, every day, and a one-in-three
// roll would delete a day's work nobody threw away. Tipping something into the
// trough has to stay a thing you do on purpose (docs/systemdocs/FACTORY.md §9).

// Mints or burns a room's own ⬢, clamped at 0 — the stash's answer to
// moveEffects.js#addResources, and a direct copy of its shape for the same
// reasons: one atomic statement rather than read-then-write (a GM's staged
// burn can race a player's Transfer into the same room), GREATEST for a clamp
// Prisma's `increment` can't express, and FOR UPDATE so nothing lands between
// the `before` this reports and the `after` it wrote. The caller records what
// MOVED, not what was asked for.
//
// This is deliberately NOT resourceTransfer.js#moveParty. That one is the
// conservation primitive — a leg of a transfer between two parties — and it
// throws when a burn overdraws, because a transfer that took less than it gave
// would mint ⬢ out of nothing. A GM adjustment has no other end to balance
// against, so the clamp is the right answer and the returned delta is the
// whole story.
//
// A room that eats what is put into it (Room.destroysContents — the Godard
// Factory's Spillway) takes no credit, the same asymmetry moveParty encodes:
// ⬢ going in goes nowhere, ⬢ coming out is still allowed.
