// minters and db/lib/paperMint.js — which this file is modelled on almost
// line for line. Every row carries `custom: true` so db:sync-tags never sees
// it and db:prune-tags skips it, plus `ephemeral: true` so a Restart Game
// sweeps it up.
//
// Takes `prisma` (or a tx) as a parameter, the db/lib/dm.js convention, and
// stays off the @lifeweb/db barrel.

// A photo lives in the PAPER group, which is a chip colour and nothing else —
// the paper SYSTEM matches on `paperKind`, and a photo carries none, so it can
// never be written on, sealed, pinned to a noticeboard or put behind the
// literacy gate. A printed photograph is a piece of card in your pocket, and
// that is the shelf it belongs on.
