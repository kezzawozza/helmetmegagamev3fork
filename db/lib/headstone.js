// "{name}'s Headstone" — what Engraving leaves behind.
//
// A stone carved for someone whose body nobody could find. Like a corpse it is
// a system-authored Tag row (`custom: true`, so no sync touches it), but unlike
// a corpse it is NOT a handle to anything: it carries no corpseOfCharacterId,
// because the person it commemorates is memorialised rather than present. It
// is an ordinary keepsake you can carry, hand over, or keep on a shelf.
//
// An UPSERT, not a create, and that is the interesting part: two mourners can
// engrave the same person, and the second must not hit the @unique on slug.
// The second one simply gets a grant of the row the first made — which is also
// the right fiction. There is one stone; more than one person can have helped.
//
// Takes a tx as the first parameter (db/lib/dm.js convention); off the barrel.
