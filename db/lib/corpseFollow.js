// The dead sheet follows its corpse. docs/systemdocs/CORPSES.md.
//
// A corpse tag is a handle to a Character row, and this is the half that makes
// that mean something: wherever the tag ends up — a Room's stash, or somebody's
// pocket — the dead character's locationId and zoneId are moved to match. Once
// they agree, db/lib/presence.js#isHere makes the body lootable there with NO
// edit to lootCharacterRequestImpl at all, and Move/Harm come along for free.
//
// PULL-BASED, and it has to be. The obvious design is to push from whatever
// moved the tag, and it cannot work: the case this feature exists for — you
// pick a body up and WALK somewhere — involves no tag write whatsoever. Only
// the carrier's own locationId changed. So this recomputes from current state
// instead of being told, the same reasoning settleCarry and
// roomAccess.js#syncCharacterRoomAccess both give.
//
// POST-COMMIT, never inside a caller's transaction: it is a plain write but it
// runs beside settleCarry, which talks to Discord.
//
// Takes `prisma` as a parameter (db/lib/dm.js convention); off the barrel.

// Where a corpse tag physically is, in precedence order:
//   1. in someone's hands  -> that holder's Location
//   2. lying in a Room     -> that Room's Location
//   3. nowhere             -> leave the dead row exactly as it is
//
// 1 beats 2 because a tag can briefly be both mid-transfer, and the pocket is
// the more specific answer. "Nowhere" is a real state (a buried or butchered
// body's tag is gone) and must never be read as "move them to null" — that
// would unplace every buried character on the next pass.
