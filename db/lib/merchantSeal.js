// The Merchant's wax stamp bears his own initials.
//
// Every other stamp in the game has its mark cut into it in docs/tags.yaml.
// His cannot: the initials are whoever took the seat this game, and the tag
// row exists before any Merchant does. So it is written once, at character
// creation, in the same breath as the line that teaches the Depot turret his
// face (web/app/(app)/character/createActions.js) — and db/lib/syncTags.js
// deliberately leaves both this field and the composed description alone for a
// stamp that names an office but carries no authored mark, so the next
// db:sync-tags cannot rub it back off.
//
// Set once and never re-synced, the same posture as the turret's face. A
// Merchant who dies and is replaced leaves his stamp behind with his initials
// still on it, which is correct: it is a physical object, and prying it off
// his body is exactly the kind of thing the game is for.
//
// Takes `prisma` (or a tx) as a parameter, the db/lib/dm.js convention, and
// stays off the @lifeweb/db barrel.
