// be what the statement actually moved rather than what the caller asked for.
// Undo reads that delta off Request.effect (REQUESTS.md §2), so an order that
// only half-cleared must report half.
//
// Takes `tx` as a parameter rather than requiring db/index.js back, the same
// convention as db/lib/dm.js — requiring the barrel from inside db/lib/
// resolves to a partial exports object.
