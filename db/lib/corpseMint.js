// it writes carries `custom: true` so db:sync-tags (upsert-by-slug) never sees
// it and db:prune-tags skips it, exactly as a GM's homebrew is protected; what
// separates it from a GM's is Tag.corpseOfCharacterId, which is also what makes
// the Restart Game wipe able to delete precisely these and nothing else.
//
// Takes `prisma` (or a tx) as a parameter, the db/lib/dm.js convention, and
// stays off the @lifeweb/db barrel.
