// The Bird — one written letter a day, to a named person in a GUESSED zone.
// Full rules in docs/systemdocs/BIRD.md.
//
// Everything here is pure: constants, the zone filter, and the exact text of
// every message the feature sends. It requires nothing at all, so all three
// callers share one copy — the web server action that sends the letter, the
// turn pass that reports a failure, and the bot handler that takes the reply.
// Copy that lived in three places would drift, and this feature's copy is
// load-bearing: "The message wasn't delivered." has to be identical whether
// the guess was wrong or the recipient was dead, or the difference between
// those two is readable from the wording.
//
// THE BIRD CARRIES AN OBJECT NOW. It used to hold text of its own, ciphered
// into runes for a recipient who could not read (db/lib/gribble.js, deleted).
// Paper replaced that: you write a letter, and the bird delivers the letter —
// so an illiterate recipient holds a real thing they cannot read, and can hand
// it to somebody who can. See docs/systemdocs/PAPERWORK.md.
//
// Client-safe: import it by path as `@lifeweb/db/lib/bird`, never through the
// @lifeweb/db barrel.

// Blind reads nothing, whatever else is on the sheet. A blind character can

// and handing it to someone who can read is the play. What they cannot do is
// work the bird themselves.
const BLIND_SLUG = "blind";

// A bird will not fly underground, and will not carry a letter out either.
// Both directions, on purpose: one-way would let someone sitting in the
// Depths send freely while being unreachable, which is a hiding place with a

// letter you are already holding, not typing one — you write with the Write
// button and post it here. That also means a reply can go out sealed.

// A GM letter's two DirectMessage sources. They exist so DmThread.js can draw
// a letter as a piece of paper (LetterBody) rather than as chat — that is all
// a `source` decides now.
//
// What each one WEIGHS on the GM desk is its `kind` (db/lib/dmKinds.js), and
// the two halves differ:
//
//   gm_letter, the outgoing half, is a NOTICE. It is the GM's own line and
//   they already know they sent it, so it should not sit in their inbox
//   waiting to be answered. (This reverses an earlier call that letters were
//   "the most conversational thing on the desk". A player-to-player letter,
//   source "bird", was the loudest case of all: it wore a string no filter
//   had ever heard of and read as mail from a stranger.)
//
//   gm_letter_reply, the incoming half, is CONVERSATION — written at the
//   insert in bot/src/lib/birdReply.js. A GM wrote a letter and this is the
//   answer to it, addressed to them. Greying it would mean a GM never learns
//   they were replied to.
//
// Both strings live in db/lib/dmKinds.js, which requires nothing and so can be
// imported by DmThread.js (a client component) directly. They used to be
// defined here and copied there as literals, kept in step by hand.
