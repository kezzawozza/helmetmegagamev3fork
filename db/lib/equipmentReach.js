// "Is that kit within reach?" — the one question Craft and Heal both ask about
// a piece of standing equipment (docs/systemdocs/CRAFTING.md, TAGS.md §5c).
//
// Two kits use this. WORKSHOP EQUIPMENT is what lets you smith or build at
// all; SURGICAL EQUIPMENT (and, since M6b, the lesser PORTABLE SURGICAL
// PACK) is what lets a tier-6/7 cure happen outside a Surgical Theater —
// see needsSurgicalSite() and healCharacterRequestImpl for the pack's own
// −1 die penalty when it's the only thing enabling the site. Both kits are
// heavy Items rather than Assets on purpose: somebody had to haul them
// there, and a Sanctuary operating theatre or a Factory floor is simply a
// room where somebody already did.
//
// Reach is NOT re-derived here. It is the same predicate the private-room
// threads are synced with — standing in the room's Location, and admitted to
// the room — so a door and a gate can never disagree about The Charon. See
// db/lib/roomAccess.js#accessibleRooms and web/lib/transferReach.js.
//
// Takes `prisma` as a parameter and stays off the @lifeweb/db barrel, the
// db/lib/dm.js convention; require it by path.

const { structuresAt } = require("./structures");

// True when the character holds the tag, one sits in a Room stash they can
// get into at the Location they are standing in, or a COMPLETE structure
// standing there provides it — a Forge declaring `provides:
// [workshop-equipment]` serves everyone on the ground, permanently, no
// hauling and no door (db/lib/structures.js). COMPLETE only: a half-built
// or damaged forge serves nobody, which is what makes Damage worth doing.
//
// `character` needs { id, locationId }. Held tags are re-read rather than
// taken from a passed row: every caller here is a server action re-checking
// what a client claimed, and a stale row is exactly what it must not trust.
