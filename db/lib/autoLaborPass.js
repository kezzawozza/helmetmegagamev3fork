// The per-turn auto-labor pass, run from db/index.js#resolveNeeds(): files a
// Labor for every ALIVE character who filed nothing on the closing turn and is

// any more — not acting IS the order, and what it buys you is a day's work.
// The consequence worth stating out loud: filing a Routine or a Gambit now
// COSTS you your labor, because Labor is a third kind of Move rather than a
// checkbox riding along with one.
//
// Files a Labor resolved like the hand-filed kind: status CONFIRMED,
// moveReviewStatus PASSED (nothing here is arbitrated), resources applied and
// snapshotted onto Action.appliedEffects so a GM can revert it, gmNotes tagged
// "auto:labor". See docs/systemdocs/LABORING.md.
