// Corpses: what one is, who it belongs to, and what comes out of it.
// docs/systemdocs/CORPSES.md owns the design; this is the shared vocabulary.
//
// The idea in one line: a corpse is a HANDLE to a dead character's sheet, not
// a container. The goods stay on the Character row and LOOT_CHARACTER is
// untouched — but db/lib/corpseFollow.js walks the dead sheet after its corpse,
// so carrying a body somewhere makes it lootable there.
//
// Lives in db/ because both faces read it: the web's Butcher/Bury actions, the
// turn passes, and the Storage button's readout. Takes `prisma` as a parameter
// (the db/lib/dm.js convention) and stays off the @lifeweb/db barrel; require
// it by path.
//
// The three pure exports at the top have no prisma in them ON PURPOSE — the
// Butcher dialog is a client component and needs MONSTER_YIELDS to preview a
// yield, and importing anything prisma-shaped there drags the barrel into the
// browser bundle and kills the route with a node:fs error.

// What each monster corpse cuts into. A corpse that isn't one of these three
// is a person's, and yields Human Flesh — keyed on "not a listed monster"
// rather than on the character link, so a corpse whose Character row has gone
// still butchers into something instead of throwing.
