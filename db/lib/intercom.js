// into. That made the PA a place you went rather than a thing in a room, and
// it cost a channel, a registry entry, a per-member access rule and a tag to
// say so. Now the announcement lands where people already are: their own
// zone's #summary.
//
// The Black Hills do not hear it. The barony's writ thins out across the
// river, and no speaker was ever strung that far. The two cave levels need no
// exclusion — they have no #summary at all, so the rock swallows the PA for
// free.

// db/lib/dm.js convention; require it by path.
