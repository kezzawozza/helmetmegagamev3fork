// What a photograph shows, as one line of prose.
//
// Pure — no prisma, no I/O — the same posture as db/lib/examine.js, which is
// where its input comes from. A photo is an Examine that stopped moving: the
// camera reads the subject exactly as a bystander standing there would, and
// then that reading is frozen onto a Tag row forever, however the subject
// changes afterwards. That freeze is the whole feature. A photo of a man
// wearing a Knight's Helmet is evidence he wore one, and it stays evidence
// after he takes it off.
//
// See docs/systemdocs/PORTRAITS.md for the avatar side of a face, which this
// deliberately does not touch — a photo is words, and words can be handed to
// somebody who was not there.

// A photo is a THING, so it says what it shows in one breath rather than in
// the embed's labelled fields. Ailments and equipment run together for the
// same reason: a picture does not separate the wound from the armour, it just
// shows you both.

// The caption, from an examineReadout() result.
//
// The concealed branch is the readout's own: a hood in a photograph is still a
// hood, and nothing about pointing a camera at somebody gets past it. What
// survives is what a bystander could see anyway — the drawn dagger, the
// bandaged hand — which is exactly what examineReadout already decided.
