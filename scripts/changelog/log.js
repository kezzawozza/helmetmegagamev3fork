// The changelog writer. One entry per push, in CHANGELOG.md and in Discord.
//
// The audience is the GM team, not a diff reader. An entry says what changed in
// the *game* — "the good labor spots now wear out as they are worked" — never
// which files moved. File paths mean nothing to a GM, and half of them would be
// noise anyway.
//
// So the notes are written by whoever pushes:
//
//   npm run push -- "Subject" "Rebalanced the labor yields" "+Labor? button"
//
// The first argument is the heading. Every argument after it is one note. A
// note may open with its own glyph; without one it is treated as a change (✎).
//
//   ✚  something new players or GMs can now do
//   −  something that went away
//   ✎  something that works differently now
//
// Those three are deliberate: none of them is a Markdown list marker, so the
// lines render literally on GitHub and in Discord with no code fence around
// them — which matters, because prose inside a fence does not wrap.
//
// `npm run push -- "Subject" --hidden` skips both halves entirely. Some pushes
// are not the GMs' business, and there is no partial version of that: nothing
// is written to CHANGELOG.md and nothing is posted.
//
// Two subjects are held back by default, whether or not --hidden is passed:
// the setting's deep lore and the antagonist seats. Players read over GM
// shoulders and GMs get briefed on those deliberately, in order. See
// SENSITIVE_PATHS / SENSITIVE_WORDS below.
//
// Committed by hand instead? `npm run changelog` reads HEAD and does both. It
// takes its notes from the commit message body — any body line starting with a
// glyph, a "-", or a "*" counts, and a bullet wrapped over several lines is
// folded back into one note.
